# Learning-Efficient Yet Generalizable Collaborative Filtering for Item Recommendation (ICML 2024) & Ranking-Consistent Softmax Approximation with Accelerated
Convergence

The Ranking-Generalizable Losses (**RG^2 & RG^\times**) method is a newly designed loss function for collaborative filtering that utilizes Alternating Least Squares for optimization.

The experimental results in our work is totally based on the highly-modularized recommendation library `RecStudio`. To run the code, please follow the instructions:

- Clone the `RecStudio` repo (https://github.com/ustcml/RecStudio) and install the dependencies, add recstudio to `PYTHONPATH`.

- Clone this repo and run the `run.py`
